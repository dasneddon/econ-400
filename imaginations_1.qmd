### Research Setting

The War on Poverty was declared by U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson in his first state of the Union Address.[^1] Federal legislation such as The Food Stamp Act, the Economic Opportunity Act, establishment of Medicare and Medicaid as extensions of Social Security, and others, marked the largest expansion of social welfare in the United States since the New Deal era.[^2]
